Generate a comprehensive retrospective analysis of the development process for this poultry farm management app. The output must include three sections:

Section 1: Detailed Retrospective Report
For each module or feature, provide:

Module/Feature Name

Challenge Description (what went wrong)

Root Cause (why it happened)

Solution/Applied Fix (how it was resolved)

Recommendation (to prevent recurrence)

Scope:

Authentication & Login (redirect loops, farmId null handling).

Farm registration & role-based access.

Intake forms (Feed Inventory, Daily Records, Sales, Health Records, Expenses, Flocks, Products).

Form submissions (decimal type mismatches, schema validation errors, farmId enforcement).

Dashboard integration (React Query invalidations, stale data).

Reporting & Charts (body weight, uniformity %, CV%, weight gain tracking).

Any other troubleshooting/debugging steps encountered during setup.

Deliver this as a structured narrative, grouped by module.

Section 2: Summary Dashboard Table
Create a summary table with the following columns:
| Module/Feature | Status (✅ working / ❌ issue) | Key Challenge | Applied Fix | Remaining Risks |

Include rows for:

Authentication/Login

Farm Registration & Role Management

Feed Inventory Form

Daily Records Form

Sales Records Form

Health Records Form

Expenses Module

Products Module

Flocks Module

Dashboard (alerts, charts, quick actions)

Reports (weight charts, uniformity, CV%)

Keep the table concise for scanning, but aligned with the detailed report.

Section 3: Cross-Module Lessons Learned
Summarize the Top 5 recurring root causes of problems during development.
For each root cause, include:

A short description of the pattern (e.g., “Data type mismatches between form input and schema expectations”).

Modules where it appeared.

The general fix that solved it.

A preventive recommendation for future modules.

Final deliverable = Detailed Retrospective Report + Summary Dashboard Table + Top 5 Root Causes in one structured output.
