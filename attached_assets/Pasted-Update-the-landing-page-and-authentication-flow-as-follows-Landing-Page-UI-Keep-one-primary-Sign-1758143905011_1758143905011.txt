Update the landing page and authentication flow as follows:

Landing Page UI

Keep one primary “Sign In” button for all users.

Directly under it, add two optional secondary buttons:

“I’m a Farmer”

“I’m a Customer”

Clicking a secondary button should store the user’s intended role (for example in a temporary cookie, sessionStorage, or context) so this intent is available immediately after login.

Post-Sign-In Behaviour

After authentication, read the user’s actual role from the database or auth provider.

Show a welcome panel before redirecting to any dashboard.

The panel should display:

The user’s name (if available) and their assigned role.

A one-sentence explanation of what that role can do (use the descriptions already in the app: admin, farm_owner, manager, staff, customer).

A clearly visible “Go to Dashboard” button that links to the correct dashboard route for that role.

Role-Based Routing

Create a single role-router function or hook that maps roles to their dashboards:

admin → /admin/dashboard

farm_owner → /farm/setup-or-dashboard

manager → /manager/dashboard

staff → /staff/dashboard

customer → /marketplace

If the role requires a farmId (manager, staff, farm_owner) and it is missing, redirect to the farm setup/onboarding page before the dashboard.

Access Control

Keep API-level guards so each endpoint still validates that the user has permission for the requested resource.

Use a shared usePermissions() hook or context to hide or show navigation links and quick actions according to role.

Deliverables

Updated React components for the landing page (with the new buttons and styling).

New welcome panel component that appears once after sign-in and then redirects to the correct dashboard when the user clicks “Go to Dashboard”.

Implementation of the role-router function and any necessary updates to the auth context or routing logic.

Brief inline comments explaining where intent is stored and how the welcome panel reads the user role.

Provide the updated code or a pull-request style diff and confirm that:

the landing page shows the new sign-in and intent buttons,

the welcome panel displays correct role information after sign-in,

users are routed to the right dashboard and cannot access dashboards outside their role,

and all API endpoints continue to enforce role and farmId requirements.
